# BenchOpt

BenchOpt (https://benchopt.github.io/) is a package to simplify, make more transparent and more reproducible the comparisons of optimization algorithms.

BenchOpt is written in Python but it is available with many programming languages. So far it has been tested with Python, R, Julia and compiled binaries written in C/C++ available via a terminal command. If it can be installed via conda it should just work!

BenchOpt is used through a command line as documented in Command Line Interface (CLI) Documentation.
